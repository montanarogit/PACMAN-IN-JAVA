# PACMAN-IN-JAVA
I am pleased to present my university project: a faithful Java recreation of the classic Pac-Man. This work allowed me to apply my skills in OOP, game logic, and graphics management. The project challenged me to solve complex problems in event handling and performance optimization, resulting in a robust, functional application.
